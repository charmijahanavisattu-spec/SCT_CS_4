# ‚å®Ô∏è Typing Speed & Accuracy Tracker

A simple Python-based typing test that measures both **typing speed** and **accuracy**.  
The program gives you a random sentence, tracks how long you take to type it, and reports your **Words Per Minute (WPM)**, **character-level accuracy**, **word-level accuracy**, and sample mistakes.
